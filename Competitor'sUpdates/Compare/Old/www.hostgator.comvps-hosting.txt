Frequently Asked Questions
When should I go with a Virtual Private Server (VPS) server?
A VPS server is an excellent choice when you are looking for more control/flexibility around your website.  Whether it is the ability to scale resources to meet the needs of your growing business or the ability to install a custom application or custom configuration that makes your site run just the way you want.
Will my VPS perform better than my Shared account does?
This answer will vary based on your site and the VPS option you select. The entry level VPS nodes are targeted towards customers looking for more flexibility and will likely not result in a performance improvement, while the higher end VPS nodes should provide both flexibility and performance improvements.
Will you migrate my site for me?
HostGator offers unlimited free  cPanel to cPanel migrations to our VPS Offering.   For sites that require a manual migration due to complexity or a different control panel, we support up to 90 migrations based on the VPS package you select.  
What type of technical skills do I need to manage a VPS server?
For our fully managed VPS server we include an easy to use custom cPanel Control Panel that offers many administrative tools but basic knowledge of file transfer and application management are beneficial.  Our semi-managed offering does not include the control panel and will require a more in depth technical expertise to keep your website running smoothly.
How many emails can I send out per hour from my VPS server? 
On a VPS server, there is no default setting within cPanel on outbound email per hour but we strongly recommend that you set it to 500 emails per hour to avoid getting your IP blacklisted by an errant or compromised script within your site.

      HostGator offers unlimited free cPanel to cPanel migrations to our VPS Offering. For sites that require a manual migration due to complexity or a different control panel, we support up to 90 migrations based on the VPS package you select.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        What type of technical skills do I need to manage a VPS server?
      
    
  
  
    
      For our fully managed VPS server we include an easy to use custom cPanel Control Panel that offers many administrative tools but basic knowledge of file transfer and application management are beneficial. Our semi-managed offering does not include the control panel and will require a more in depth technical expertise to keep your website running smoothly.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        How many emails can I send out per hour from my VPS server?
      
    
  
  
    
      On a VPS server, there is no default setting within cPanel on outbound email per hour but we strongly recommend that you set it to 500 emails per hour to avoid getting your IP blacklisted by an errant or compromised script within your site.

          HostGator Website Transfers
        
        
          HostGator is committed to making it easy to transfer your site to your new hosting account. We can transfer website files, databases, scripts, and  one free domain registration transfer.
          What qualifies me for a free transfer?
          HostGator provides free transfers for new accounts within 30 days of sign-up, and to newly upgraded accounts. For upgraded accounts it must be an inter-server upgrade to qualify. Please note that downgraded accounts do not qualify for free transfers.
          Depending on which type of account you sign up for, we offer differing numbers of free transfers. Please refer to the chart below to see what we include for new packages.
          Full cPanel Transfers is the number of cPanel to cPanel transfers that are included.
          Max. Manual Transfers is the maximum number of Manual Transfers that are included with your account.
          Total Free Transfers is the total number websites that we will move for you.

VPS accounts that have a control panel (either cPanel or Plesk) qualify for unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, or up to 10 Manual Transfers per VPS level. I.E. a Level 5 VPS qualifies for 50 manual transfers, while a Level 7 qualifies for 70 manual transfers.
(Snappy 500 or VPS without a control panel)
VPS accounts with no control panel are for advanced Linux customers who are comfortable with installing and configuring their own services. If you would like us to transfer their data to such a VPS (or a Dedicated server with no control panel), you would be responsible for making sure that their services are configured correctly and will need to inform us exactly where the data needs to be placed (we will not configure or restore anything, but only copy files or packages to the specified directory on the VPS/server). If you are not comfortable with installing and configuring their own services, we suggest upgrading to a Level 3 plan with cPanel. We will not be able to install and configure each service for you. If a Level 3 package is too expensive, then a Reseller or Shared account might work based upon your needs."?

          1While we can do unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers for you, depending on your account, you will have a limited number of Manual Transfers.
          2Full cPanel transfers include all domains, Addon Domains, Subdomains, and cPanel settings. This will also include your emails and email accounts. Please note that this does require that your old host's cPanel backup generator to be active.
          A few examples: An Aluminium Reseller account includes up to 30 free transfers. Out of this 30, you can have 20 cPanel to cPanel transfers and 10 Manual Transfers, or any combination of the two that totals 30 or less websites. Another example: A Pro Dedicated server includes unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, this means you can have 150 sites (or even more) moved. Also since there is an unlimited total number of transfers, you can utilize up to 100 Manual Transfers.

          Unmetered Web Hosting
        
        
          How much disk space and bandwidth will my plan include?
          Diskspace and Bandwidth is "Unmetered" which means you are not charged according to the amount of diskspace or bandwidth you use.
          However, that being said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and to only utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website.
          For example, customers who are using 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds would be in violation of our Terms of Service. Please see our TOS or contact us with any questions.
          What happens if I exceed usage?
          If we have concerns about your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage.
          Again, it is very rare for a customer who is managing a personal or small business website to exceed our usage policies.
