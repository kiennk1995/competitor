Frequently asked questions.
How am I billed for my instances?
All virtual machines on your account are billed hourly up to the monthly rate cap. The hourly rate is determined by dividing the monthly rate by 672 hours (28 days). If your machine is online for more than 672 hours in a calendar month, you will only be billed the monthly rate. Accumulated charges are invoiced to your account on the 1st of every month.
Do you charge for stopped instances?
Yes, instances in a stopped state continue to reserve dedicated system resources (RAM, SSD storage, IP aliases, CPU) and therefore incur charges until you destroy the instance. If you wish to no longer accumulate charges for a virtual machine, please use the DESTROY button in the customer portal.
What operating system templates do you offer?
See our full list of operating systems.
Does VAT apply for European Union customers?
Vultr.com is required to collect VAT (Value Added Tax) for customers that reside in the EU. VAT is not charged to Business or Charity customers that provide a valid VAT registration. You may enter your VAT registration in your customer portal&#039;s settings section. Our prices do not include VAT - VAT will be added to your invoice as a separate line item.
At what rate is overage bandwidth billed?
Bandwidth utilization in excess of instance allocation is charged at $0.01 per GB in North American and Western European locations. Due to higher regional costs, Singapore and Tokyo (Japan) overage is priced at $0.025 per GB and Sydney (Australia) overage is priced at $0.05 per GB.
