   Frequently Asked Questions
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Is web hosting necessary for a website?
      
    
  
  
    
      Yes - you need three things to have a functioning website: a domain name, web hosting, and site files. You can think of your domain as your street address, your web host as the space you rent to have your business in, and your site files as the items in your office. Your web host provides the server where your site files (including blog posts, images, landing pages, and more) live so they can be accessed at yourdomain.com.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        How does shared web hosting work?
      
    
  
  
    
      The "shared" in shared hosting refers to the fact that multiple websites are sharing a single web server. Shared is a perfect option for new bloggers or small websites that are just getting started online who need an economical option. As your site traffic grows, you can seamlessly upgrade at any time to a different hosting plan such as cloud hosting.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        How do I choose the right shared hosting plan?
      
    
  
  
    
      The Baby Plan is our most popular shared hosting plan, as it's budget-friendly but allows you to host as many domains as you like. The Business Plan also includes a private SSL (required for e-commerce) and a dedicated IP, making it a great fit for online stores. Regardless of which plan you choose, all of our shared hosting plans come with unlimited emails, easy one-click installs of WordPress and other popular content platforms, and 24/7/365 expert support.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Can I transfer my web hosting to HostGator?
      
    
  
  
    
      Definitely. HostGator offers FREE site transfers for new accounts within 30 days of signup. We're committed to making web hosting easy and stress-free!

          HostGator Website Transfers
        
        
          HostGator is committed to making it easy to transfer your site to your new hosting account. We can transfer website files, databases, scripts, and  one free domain registration transfer.
          What qualifies me for a free transfer?
          HostGator provides free transfers for new accounts within 30 days of sign-up, and to newly upgraded accounts. For upgraded accounts it must be an inter-server upgrade to qualify. Please note that downgraded accounts do not qualify for free transfers.
          Depending on which type of account you sign up for, we offer differing numbers of free transfers. Please refer to the chart below to see what we include for new packages.
          Full cPanel Transfers is the number of cPanel to cPanel transfers that are included.
          Max. Manual Transfers is the maximum number of Manual Transfers that are included with your account.
          Total Free Transfers is the total number websites that we will move for you.

                    Please submit the online form to initiate your website content transfers.
VPS accounts that have a control panel (either cPanel or Plesk) qualify for unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, or up to 10 Manual Transfers per VPS level. I.E. a Level 5 VPS qualifies for 50 manual transfers, while a Level 7 qualifies for 70 manual transfers.
(Snappy 500 or VPS without a control panel)
VPS accounts with no control panel are for advanced Linux customers who are comfortable with installing and configuring their own services. If you would like us to transfer their data to such a VPS (or a Dedicated server with no control panel), you would be responsible for making sure that their services are configured correctly and will need to inform us exactly where the data needs to be placed (we will not configure or restore anything, but only copy files or packages to the specified directory on the VPS/server). If you are not comfortable with installing and configuring their own services, we suggest upgrading to a Level 3 plan with cPanel. We will not be able to install and configure each service for you. If a Level 3 package is too expensive, then a Reseller or Shared account might work based upon your needs."?

          1While we can do unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers for you, depending on your account, you will have a limited number of Manual Transfers.
          2Full cPanel transfers include all domains, Addon Domains, Subdomains, and cPanel settings. This will also include your emails and email accounts. Please note that this does require that your old host's cPanel backup generator to be active.
          A few examples: An Aluminium Reseller account includes up to 30 free transfers. Out of this 30, you can have 20 cPanel to cPanel transfers and 10 Manual Transfers, or any combination of the two that totals 30 or less websites. Another example: A Pro Dedicated server includes unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, this means you can have 150 sites (or even more) moved. Also since there is an unlimited total number of transfers, you can utilize up to 100 Manual Transfers.

          Unmetered Web Hosting
        
        
          How much disk space and bandwidth will my plan include?
          Diskspace and Bandwidth is "Unmetered" which means you are not charged according to the amount of diskspace or bandwidth you use.
          However, that being said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and to only utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website.
          For example, customers who are using 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds would be in violation of our Terms of Service. Please see our TOS or contact us with any questions.
          What happens if I exceed usage?
          If we have concerns about your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage.
          Again, it is very rare for a customer who is managing a personal or small business website to exceed our usage policies.
