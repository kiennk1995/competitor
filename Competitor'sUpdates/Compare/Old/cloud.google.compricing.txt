                  No upfront costs required: You don't need to make
                  commitments to get great prices. Google Cloud Platform
                  is on average 60% less for many compute workloads than
                  other clouds1, with $0
                  paid upfront.

                  Building data centers is probably not your business. By
                  paying for services on an as-needed basis, you save money
                  and direct more focus to innovation.
