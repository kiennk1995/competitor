   Frequently Asked Questions
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Is email included with WordPress hosting?
      
    
  
  
    
      Absolutely! Free email hosting is included with all HostGator hosting plans. You can create unlimited email addresses @yourdomain.com for a professional, branded look. We also integrate with G Suite if you'd like access to Google apps for team collaboration.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        What are the advantages of WordPress hosting over shared?
      
    
  
  
    
      Unlike shared hosting, our managed WordPress hosting server environment was designed specifically with WordPress in mind. This means you can enjoy faster page times (up to 1 second faster), a higher level of protection against WordPress-specific attacks, and automatic WordPress updates. A safer, faster site makes everyone happy!
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Is WordPress hosting worth it?
      
    
  
  
    
      If you plan to grow your blog or business for more traffic (and who isn't?), then the benefits of WordPress hosting are well worth it. Even if you're starting with something basic today, opting for a managed WordPress hosting environment now gives you a reliable foundation to expand on in the future when you're ready.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Will you transfer my site?
      
    
  
  
    
      Sure! Depending on which plan you choose, we will transfer 1, 2, or 3 existing WordPress sites over to our platform - for FREE. All of your content will be safely moved over so you don't experience any interruption or downtime during the migration process.
    
  
  
    
      
          
        Why should I host with HostGator?
      
    
  
  
    
      Our managed WordPress hosting plans are structured for maximum value when compared to other brands. Enjoy more storage, more email, and free migration services when you choose HostGator managed WordPress hosting. Plus, if you ever need a hand, our WordPress experts are standing by 24/7/365.

          HostGator Website Transfers
        
        
          HostGator is committed to making it easy to transfer your site to your new hosting account. We can transfer website files, databases, scripts, and  one free domain registration transfer.
          What qualifies me for a free transfer?
          HostGator provides free transfers for new accounts within 30 days of sign-up, and to newly upgraded accounts. For upgraded accounts it must be an inter-server upgrade to qualify. Please note that downgraded accounts do not qualify for free transfers.
          Depending on which type of account you sign up for, we offer differing numbers of free transfers. Please refer to the chart below to see what we include for new packages.
          Full cPanel Transfers is the number of cPanel to cPanel transfers that are included.
          Max. Manual Transfers is the maximum number of Manual Transfers that are included with your account.
          Total Free Transfers is the total number websites that we will move for you.

VPS accounts that have a control panel (either cPanel or Plesk) qualify for unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, or up to 10 Manual Transfers per VPS level. I.E. a Level 5 VPS qualifies for 50 manual transfers, while a Level 7 qualifies for 70 manual transfers.
(Snappy 500 or VPS without a control panel)
VPS accounts with no control panel are for advanced Linux customers who are comfortable with installing and configuring their own services. If you would like us to transfer their data to such a VPS (or a Dedicated server with no control panel), you would be responsible for making sure that their services are configured correctly and will need to inform us exactly where the data needs to be placed (we will not configure or restore anything, but only copy files or packages to the specified directory on the VPS/server). If you are not comfortable with installing and configuring their own services, we suggest upgrading to a Level 3 plan with cPanel. We will not be able to install and configure each service for you. If a Level 3 package is too expensive, then a Reseller or Shared account might work based upon your needs."?

          1While we can do unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers for you, depending on your account, you will have a limited number of Manual Transfers.
          2Full cPanel transfers include all domains, Addon Domains, Subdomains, and cPanel settings. This will also include your emails and email accounts. Please note that this does require that your old host's cPanel backup generator to be active.
          A few examples: An Aluminium Reseller account includes up to 30 free transfers. Out of this 30, you can have 20 cPanel to cPanel transfers and 10 Manual Transfers, or any combination of the two that totals 30 or less websites. Another example: A Pro Dedicated server includes unlimited cPanel to cPanel transfers, this means you can have 150 sites (or even more) moved. Also since there is an unlimited total number of transfers, you can utilize up to 100 Manual Transfers.

          Unmetered Web Hosting
        
        
          How much disk space and bandwidth will my plan include?
          Diskspace and Bandwidth is "Unmetered" which means you are not charged according to the amount of diskspace or bandwidth you use.
          However, that being said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and to only utilize disk space and bandwidth in the normal operation of a personal or small business website.
          For example, customers who are using 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds would be in violation of our Terms of Service. Please see our TOS or contact us with any questions.
          What happens if I exceed usage?
          If we have concerns about your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage.
          Again, it is very rare for a customer who is managing a personal or small business website to exceed our usage policies.
